USER BIOGRAPHY:
Rafey is a software engineer and entrepreneur. He moved to the United Kingdom in 2016 in a persuit of a better life. He received scholarships throughout his education to sustain himself. Rafey lives by four principles: Frugality, Grit, Love and Curiosity. He is a big fan of the book "The Creative Act" by Rick Rubin. In his free time he likes playing the piano and producing music.

USER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
- Research Scientist at Guy's and St Thomas'â€‹ NHS Foundation Trust (July 2018 - October 2018): Worked closely with senior physicians @ Guy's Hospital to develop a web application to detect irregularities in MRI scans. The tool analyzes DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files from MRI machines, extracts technical imaging parameters, stores them in a database, and provides visualization tools to identify potentially abnormal parameter values that could indicate equipment issues or scanning problems.
- Software Engineer at HotelMap (July 2019 - August 2020): Contributed to the backend infrastructure of HotelMap, a hotel discovery and booking platform. He architected and implemented an automated email marketing system that monitors customer engagement, tracks active users throughout their journey, and systematically collects post-stay feedback to enhance the platform's service quality and user experience.
- Research Scientist at Identity Methods (August 2020 - December 2021): Developed an AI-powered access management system that leverages machine learning to provide intelligent authentication and authorization solutions for enterprise clients. Led the synthetic data generation pipeline to create diverse, representative datasets for model training, ensuring robust performance across various real-world scenarios while maintaining data privacy compliance. Conducted comprehensive model evaluation and benchmarking, experimenting with multiple machine learning architectures including neural networks, ensemble methods, and traditional ML algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics such as accuracy, latency, and scalability to identify the optimal solution that balanced security requirements with user experience. 
- Founding Engineer at Astrobit (December 2021 - April 2022): Worked with leading aerospace organization to implement a high-performance satellite data processing pipeline capable of handling multi-terabyte data streams from Earth observation satellites. Developed a Python library that serves as the client's core framework for satellite data manipulation and analysis. The library features modular components for data ingestion, preprocessing, geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and advanced analytics. Implemented optimized algorithms for handling various satellite data formats (including GeoTIFF, NetCDF, and HDF5).
- Co-Founder at Nannie.ai (March 2024 - September 2024): Founded an innovative pet technology startup that leverages generative AI to create personalized entertainment experiences for pets. Developed proprietary algorithms that analyze pet behavior patterns, preferences, and engagement metrics to generate custom interactive content, games, and activities tailored to individual animals' cognitive abilities and play styles. The platform combines computer vision for real-time pet recognition, natural language processing for owner interactions, and generative AI models to create dynamic, engaging content that adapts based on pet responses. Key features include AI-generated puzzle games, virtual play sessions, and automated treat-dispensing mechanisms synchronized with digital activities, addressing the growing market need for pet mental stimulation and remote owner-pet interaction. Successfully pitched to and secured meetings with tier-one venture capital firms, demonstrating strong product-market fit through rapid user adoption and engagement metrics. The business achieved a $10 million valuation within 7 months of launch, driven by compelling unit economics, a scalable technology infrastructure, and a clear vision for expanding into adjacent markets including pet health monitoring and behavioral training. The venture attracted interest from leading VCs specializing in consumer technology and AI applications, positioning the company for significant growth in the $260+ billion global pet industry.
- Founder at Insight OS (June 2025 - Present): Currently reimagining the future of writing.

Note: None of the above professional experiences as founder are based on successful exits.
